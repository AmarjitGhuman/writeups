# 100 Days of Boxes
You've heard of 100 days of code, but have you heard of 100 days of boxes? That's right, hacking
one box a day - in addition to doing a writeup of dubious quality.

"Wow, this challenge sounds awesome!" you say. It certainly does. It is important to keep in mind,
however, that I'm currently a computer science student at university, and this sort of challenge
is absolutely infeasible for anyone with either a job or a life. 

## Box Sources

Note: Any writeup I do for any active HTB boxes will be password protected by the root flag for
that box, as to not break the HTB TOS.
